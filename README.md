# Bank-Management-System
This project implements a simple command-line based bank management system using Python.
The system allows customers to perform basic banking operations, including: Account Creation: Open a new account with an initial deposit. Deposit: Add funds to an existing account. Withdrawal: Deduct funds from an existing account, with overdraft protection. Balance Enquiry: Check the current balance of an account. Account Closure: Close an existing account, transferring remaining funds to the customer.

Features: Object-Oriented Design: Utilizes classes and inheritance to represent accounts and customers. Data Persistence: Accounts and customer data are stored using simple file handling (JSON format). Validation and Error Handling: Includes checks for valid input and error handling for common scenarios (e.g., insufficient funds). Security: Basic security measures such as PIN verification for withdrawals and closures.

Technologies Used: Python 3.x: Core programming language. Command Line Interface (CLI): Provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the system.

How to Contribute: Fork the repository, clone locally, and start contributing. Create issues for bugs, feature requests, or enhancements. Submit pull requests to improve the functionality or add new features.

Future Improvements: Encryption: Implement data encryption for enhanced security. GUI: Develop a graphical user interface for easier interaction. Database Integration: Use a database like SQLite for more robust data management.
